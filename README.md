My first assignment for school using SQL Db server to manage the program.
This is only the code tho, but it might be fun to look back at in the future :)

This is supposed to be an application to sell items like on craigslist, or the swedish Blocket.
This application is based in 3 usage areas:
1. To be able to view all items that are for sale (logged in or not)
2. create a user
3. to be able to manage their own adds on a "user"-page


It was a fun project to learn from and also to get to look back on later on in life as a fun memory from school! :)
